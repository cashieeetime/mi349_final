                <h3>Simple Password Manager</h3>
                <address>Posted by Cashie, on December 10th, 2022</address>

                <p>A few months ago, after getting absolutely fed up with remembering and managing my passwords, I decided to use my python knowledge to create a password manager. I’ve been working on it pretty much all of the first semester of my 3rd year of college, and I’ve finally gotten to the point where I’m happy with what I’ve created.</p>

                <p>Since I will be using this program for my internship applications this year, I asked my dad what I could do better. He suggested the new name—which is the one I am currently using—along with a few other things I could add to make my program even better.</p>
                    
                <p>This is only the first draft, and I’ve created a fresh new repository to continue with the second draft of the program. I’ll be linking the Git repository for my first draft below.

                <p>You may or may not be wondering what I do on my spare time when I'm not coding, and I mentioned in the about section of my website that I like to write and play games, so I thought I would drop some of my other links here. You can find my writing on my instagram and tumblr, and my gaming stuff on twitch and youtube.
